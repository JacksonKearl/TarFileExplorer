TAR File Explorer
=================

An HTML/JavaScript application that allows the user to upload a TAR file, view, add, download, or remove the files contained within it, and then download the modified archive.

### This Fork

Forked to imporove perf and better support distribution as a single file incorporated into a larger appication (removed addition of properties to global prototypes, rendering code, and writing files).
